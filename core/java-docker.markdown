very impressive.  the grind that they went through.

java class files can be fully extracted and thus utilize docker's filesystem management.

if the java class can be translated into docker's filesystem management protocol, java functionalities can be specified in docker images.

so interpretation of java files could be run to create a compiled system, not a class.

some near-java compile programming, something i don't have time for now.
