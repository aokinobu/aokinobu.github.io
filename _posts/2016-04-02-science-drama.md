It began with me listening to a lecture once again of a subject that I was not familiar.  A person next to me was very serious and a bit frantic in preparation for something.  He seemed a bit arrogant and confident.  I had a lot of papers and trash on the floor and was organizing them while listening to the lecture.

Thoughts brought me back to the times where I going to religious events and celebrations.  I would also be brought back home in Elk Grove as strange things going around and trick-or-treating was cancelled.  My brother was frantic and we meditated together to calm down.

Back to the lecture, there was a discussion happening and an elder man was disputing his own proof on a subject of objects and their environments.  This was mainly about physics and motion.  The person next to me became a bit frantic and started to go through his own papers, dropping some of them on the floor.  I started to clean up more, my brother picked up a paper and started recording what on it.  14014. which confused me with 14400, a baud modem speed.

When the speaker asked a question about his own subject suddenly the person next to me interrupts him and begins to assert himself and some of the ideas of his that proofs were based on.  He starts to wring on the whiteboard what his proof discusses.  However the speaker then interrupts him and erases the parts of the moving objects that the frantic person wrote.  He explains that he disputes the original proofs.  He writes how up until now, specific areas of the objects moving were considered "alpha" writing the alpha latin symbol, but then starts to erase to show that there is no proof of it being alpha in the beginning.

This is because it has been seen that the spaces have changed over time, and so the proof that it is still alpha doesn't exist.

Thoughts about a religious lecture I had attended, where a person was giving a lecture, and people would openly discuss.  One person was very dramatic and could not be completely understood.

Back to the lecture room, one lady who is very calm and yet has some knowledge of the subject is reviewing the discussion.  I notice that people are outside in the hallway thinking about the issue.  Ten is tapping her head with a program book to jog thoughts.  I look back at what the lady is writing, and people are backtracking how they got here.  The original lecturer mentions one hidden article that mentioned these changes and actually had a proof of how it changed.  For some reason the objects moving through the space would reach a specific animal.  This makes it more of a biological aspect to it.

To the right are more primitive species, with the left showing more advanced ones, it shows how a lizard is reached in the assumed case, when someone screams "mice!".

The objects that are possible are seen again, and it shows how mice are behind the lizard, and cannot be reached.  Thus one is the alpha in this case, and could not be reached because of the lizard and something else.

The general idea being that the experiment shows how the generally assumed case cannot be possible, and yet it is for some reason.  Mice are reached when it should not.  People scream their hatred for mice, "Rotten, warm-blooded rodents"

The warm-blooded word sparks an idea for the lady, and she repeats the word warm.  The environment at the time for the experiment could have been warm.  Thus showing how noone was thinking about yet another aspect of the experiment, the temperature at which it took place.
