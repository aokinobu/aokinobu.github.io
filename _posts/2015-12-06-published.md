description: the international glycan repository
---
So this site that I have been working on for the past year or so was finally ready for the first release.  It is basically a repository in order to easier reference glycan structure data.

It was quite an interesting project as there wasn't exactly a reference site to get a good image of.

Along with the architecture and development involved I wrote some documentation about how the site works as well as the architecture.  This was reformatted as a publication for [Nucleic Acids Research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26476458) Database edition.

It was a lot of work and was very nice to see the results in a completed format.

However I am left with some dissatisfaction, as I really feel I could have done more.  We will see what this next year will result in.
