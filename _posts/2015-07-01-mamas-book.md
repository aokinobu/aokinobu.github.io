My mom has been working on a book for many years, and finally found the opportunity to write one for a major Japanese publisher.

It's now available on amazon here:
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4286160645/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4286160645&linkCode=as2&tag=aokinobu-22" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://ws-fe.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=4286160645&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=JP&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=aokinobu-22" ></a><img src="http://ir-jp.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=aokinobu-22&l=as2&o=9&a=4286160645" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Sorry to non-Japanese readers, it's only in her native language.  It's also why I am having some trouble finishing it.

I do know however that it is the story about a young Japanese woman who was arranged to be married and just a few days later left to live together in a foreign land.  It is quite a unique experience, especially considering the time when moving across the world was rare.
